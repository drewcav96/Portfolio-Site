        About Me

    <Content>
        <p class="my-4">
            My software developing journey began back in grade school when I first showed interest in making computer games.
            Coding logic, designing UIs, and packaging programs for release is what drives me to keep learning.
            My passion is solving problems with customized software solutions.
        </p>

        <p class="my-4">
            My expertise is designing full-scale software solutions to complex business problems, both forward-facing to clients and internally for employees.
            With a decade in .NET experience as a hobby and 4+ years professionally, I am very comfortable with object-oriented programming, data structures, test-driven development, and more.
            Though much of my experience is in .NET, I am familiar with other frameworks and eager to apply my professional experience to learn new practices.
        </p>

        <p class="my-4">
            To know more about me, I love to travel! I have explored National Parks, monuments, and attractions in over two-thirds of the United States as well as parts of Canada, and Mexico.
            I look forward to visiting Scotland one day to explore my heritage, and hope to explore much of the Eastern world throughout the rest of my life.
            My other hobbies involve following
